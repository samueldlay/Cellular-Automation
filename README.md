## A frontend React app created as a visual component to the Game of Life algorithm

### From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) page: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input."
